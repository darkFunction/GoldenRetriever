# GoldenRetriever

A friendly and light `enum` based library for fetching your data from a HTTP/S endpoint.

Let me guess, your iOS application needs to interact with a HTTP server to send and retreive data. GoldenRetriever allows you to specify all of your endpoints in a single, clear `enum`format with in-built support for JSON and `Codable` types, as well as authentication headers. The request syntax couldn't be easier- no need for a middle-man class to encapsulate interactions with your backend.

## Define your endpoints
